## About Tech Test

Create a single application which connects to an RSS feed, pulls that feed into a database and outputs them into
a suitable UI.

A JavaScript snippet should also be created which will listen for a click on the feed only when the alt key is depressed
to follow the feed URL and view the article online

Clicking anywhere else should hide the button again

## Plan

- Find an RSS feed (Twitter?, already using blog posts on portfolio?)
- Create APIs for subscribing to new feeds / pulling content from feeds


## Future Plan
- Protect APIs against potential attacks (Subscribing to feeds we don't want)
